# 🏦 Terminal-Based Bank Management System (C++)

A simple terminal-based banking application built in **C++** to simulate basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming** and **STL vectors** in C++.

## 🚀 Features

- Create a new bank account
- View account details
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Display all accounts
- Search account by account number

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing **classes and objects** in C++
- Using **vectors** to store dynamic lists of accounts
- Writing clean and modular C++ code
- Handling user input and performing basic validation
- Applying object-oriented principles like **encapsulation**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (`vector`)
- Terminal/CLI
